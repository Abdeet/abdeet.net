		<h1 class="main-article-subheading">Letter to Leah Price-Ngemba on the arrest of her husband Anatole Ngemba</h1>
		<p class="article-text"><i>A copy of this letter was provided to us by Mrs. Price-Ngemba a few years ago, upon our request for any material she had. The letter was from the Zairian authorities and detailed her husband's arrest for "seditious activities".</i></p>
		<br>
		<p class="article-text">Dear Mrs. Price-Ngemba,</p>
		<p class="article-text">This letter is to inform you that your husband, Anatole Ngemba, has been arrested for seditious activities on the orders of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Your husband is guilty of fomenting unrest and organizing an uprising through his association with several student organizations. His trial is scheduled for a year from this date.</p>
		<p class="article-text">Should you want to visit him, please come to the police headquarters in Kinshasa and meet with an officer. To expedite his trial, you can meet with an officer, but please note that the system is currently backlogged, and as such it will take considerable "influence" to have such a wish granted. We cannot assure his access to food and water but with a significant donation we will do our best to care for him.</p>
		<p class="article-text">Please note that any attempt to help him escape will lead to his death and your imprisonment. For such an offense, the average sentence is ten to twenty years, but with some convincing and good behavior that could be brought down.</p>
		<p class="article-text">We hope to see you at police headquarters in the near future.</p>
		<p class="article-text">Regards,</p>
		<p class="article-text">Zairian Civil Guard</p>
