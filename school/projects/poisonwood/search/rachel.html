		<p class="article-text"><i>This article is from an edition of the Times in 1988. Our travel reporters visited the Equatorial hotel and wrote about their experience there. Rachel, as the owner of the hotel, features prominently.</i></p>

		<p class="article-text">On a sunny, summer morning, my colleague and I packed our bags and hit the road We were planning to visit the Equatorial hotel, which we had gotten quite a few recommendations for. The hotel was amazingly well maintained. The walls looked freshly painted, but I could tell they always looked like that. Inside, after getting our key from the receptionist, we took the elevator to our room. The room was spotless, a pleasant surprise. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms well stocked. Once we had freshened up and left our luggage, we decided to go see what the Equatorial offered in terms of amenities.</p>
		<p class="article-text">Once we headed downstairs, we ran into the owner of the hotel, Rachel Axelroot DuPree Fairley. She offered to give us a tour of the premises. Up first was the pool, which she told us was her favorite part of the hotel. While we lounged in the warm water, we asked her about her past. She wouldn't give us specifics, but she told us she was from the United States, and that she had been married three times before. We asked her about what it was like managing a hotel in a relatively unstable part of the world, and she gave us a choice bit of wisdom. She ignored things she didn't want to see, and focused all her efforts into maintaining the Equatorial and pleasing guests.</p>
		<p class="article-text">After the pool, we saw the bar and minigolf course. The drinks at the bar were great, and minigolf is always fun to play. However, soon the sun was setting and it was time for us to head back to the office. We definitely enjoyed the Equatorial, and with its affordable prices and great quality it is a top place to visit when you get a chance. We hope we can visit it again.</p>
