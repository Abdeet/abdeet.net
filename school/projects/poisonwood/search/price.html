		<h1 class="main-article-subheading">Profile of the Price Family</h1>
		<p class="article-text"><i>This profile is from the cache of classified CIA documents that were leaked to The Kilanga Times a few years ago. The identity of the author is unknown, as is that of the leaker. This profile is a good place to start understanding who the Price family are, and some of their idiosyncracies.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p class="article-text">A missionary family arrived in the Belgian Congo six months ago from the United States. The Price family, hailing from Bethlehem, Georgia, is made up of a mother, a father, and four daughters.</p>
		<p class="article-text">The father, Nathan, is also the pastor and the most fervent religiously. He is fully dedicated to his noble goal of converting the natives of the Congo to Christianity. He is well-versed in the Biblical studies and believes in them quite literally, much to the detriment of his family members. He is a very proud man - arrogant, self-confident, stubborn - and as such has had no success converting the locals. He is deemed little threat to current CIA operations in the region.</p>
		<p class="article-text">The mother, Orleanna, does not seem to be in support of the relocation to Kilanga. She is not as dedicated to the mission of spreading Christianity as her husband. While she seems to go along with him for the most part, at times she will put her foot down, mostly to protect her daughters. She seems to have the will to survive and has dragged her children with her through the adversities they have faced so far. She does not pose any threat to American interests at the moment. </p>
		<p class="article-text">The oldest daughter, Rachel, seems to have had the hardest transition to the Congo. She is a typical American teenager, very materialistic, and as such has had a tough time without the possessions of her former home. She suffers from an inferiority complex brought on by being older sister to the gifted twins. She seems to be looking for a way out of the Congo, and does not seem particularly fond of her family. She could be useful to the CIA as an intelligence asset.
		<p class="article-text">The two twins, Leah and Adah, couldn't be any different from each other. Leah is the older one, and a devout Christian. She looks up to her father and takes his word as gospel. As such, she is not expected to be any sort of threat to current power structures in Africa. However, she is known to associate with Anatole Ngembe, a local schoolteacher who has links to Patrice Lumumba and Congo independence movements. Her association does not seem to go beyond a childhood crush on him. Adah, on the other hand, is hemiplegic and mute. She does not talk to others much or share her thoughts, and so not much is known about her or her beliefs. She is also a gifted student and has a knack for school. Due to her physical situation, she is not considered a danger. Both twins have been spotted spying on intelligence asset Eeben Axelroot, but this is more out of curiosity than any sort of suspicion.</p>
		<p class="article-text">Ruth May, the youngest, is too little to understand the situation fully. She spends her days playing with the other children in the village and running around. She is definitely not any threat to the CIA mission in the Congo.</p>
		<p class="article-text">As this article has shown, the Prices, while consisting of interesting characters, do not seem to pose a threat to American interests. They are a devout Christian family that seems more likely to get killed than to cause any real trouble. The CIA need not keep tabs on the Price family.</p>
