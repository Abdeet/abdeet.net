		<h1 class="main-article-subheading">Account of a game of Mother May I</h1>
		<p class="article-text"><i>This is a transcript of a Radio Kilanga broadcast. In this broadcast, a reporter goes to Kilanga to see an unusual sight, children speaking English and playing Mother May I. This document gives us the best insight into Ruth May's disposition before her death.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p class="article-text"><b>HOST: </b>Thanks for the weather report, Sylvestre! Now, let's go to Clementine for an interesting news story. In the village of Kilanga, the children are speaking English! Is that correct Clementine?</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>Exactly correct, Felix. In Kilanga, which is very rural, children can be heard running around and saying "Mother May I". We believe this is a common game played in America.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>HOST: </b>And how are the children in Kilanga playing an American game?</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>They are learning it from a young American girl, Ruth May. She is part of the Price family, an American missionary family that arrived in Kilanga just a short while ago. Ruth May almost immediately began playing with the other children, and before long she had them playing Mother May I. We got the chance to speak to young Ruth May after one game ended.<p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CUT TO INTERVIEW</b></p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>So, Ruth May, how are you enjoying Kilanga so far?</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>RUTH MAY: </b>I like it a lot here. Back at home, I can never play Mother May I because all my sisters are older than me and none of them will play with me. Here, there are so many people to play with and I get to be the one in charge. The only thing is no one really understands how to play the game all that well but I'm fine with that.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>(laughing) I see! Do you know why you and your family are here</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>RUTH MAY: </b>My father says that we are here to bring god and religion to the Tribes of Ham. Are you a tribe of Ham?</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. Can you tell me -</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CUT BACK TO STUDIO</b></p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>CLEMENTINE: </b>Unfortunately, at that point our interview was cut short by Ruth May's mother calling her in for dinner.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>HOST: </b>Well, that was one interesting story. Make sure to keep us posted Clementine! Ladies and gentlemen, that was Clementine Ilunga for Radio Kilanga. Thank you for listening and until next time, I am Felix Kasongo. Good night.</p>
