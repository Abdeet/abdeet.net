		<h1 class="main-article-subheading">Interview with Adah Price, medical student</h1>
		<p class="article-text"><i>This article was published in the Emory Wheel soon after Adah's enrollment. It is particularly interesting because Adah does not mention her time in the Congo much except for anecdotes to prove points of hers. It is also fascinating because the interview was conducted shortly after Adah's miraculous recovery, and she is candid about the change.</i></p>

		<p class="article-text">I had the chance to sit down with Adah Price, one of the medical students here at Emory University and ask her about her background and inspiration for entering the medical field. We met at a local coffee shop by the medical quad.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>Hey Adah! It's great to meet you in person. Why don't we start with an easy question. Where are you from?</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">Hi! It's nice to meet you too. I was born in Bethlehem, Georgia, where I lived for the first fourteen years of my life. At fourteen, I moved to the Congo with my family, and I lived there for a few years. Once I moved back, I decided to enroll in Emory and here we are.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>Wait a minute...Congo? You have to tell us more about that!</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">Well, we moved there because my father was- is a missionary. There's not much else to say about it. What's next?</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>Alright then... how about this. Why did you decide to become a doctor?</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">I was born with hemiplegia. For most of my life, the left side of my body was completely paralyzed. I was functionally mute. This was the reason I decided to become a doctor.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>You're telling me you have hemiplegia? You seem completely fine. What happened?</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">One of the other students in the program told me he thought he could cure it. He had me do an intensive regiment of trying to walk without any support. For weeks, I was just crawling on the floor, but after a while I could walk without any support. Now, I am essentially fully recovered.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>How does it feel having full function of your body again?</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">To be honest, it's a mixed bag. On one hand it is nice not being treated differently, but at the same time I miss a lot of the things I lost. For one, I am a much more boring person now, and I mean that sincerely. When I was paralyzed and mute, I saw the world in a different way. It made me more perceptive. Now, I see the world just like everyone else. They have the right idea in the Congo. There, no one sees you any different whether you have control of all your limbs or you are fully paralyzed.</p>
		<p class="article-text"><b>That's an interesting perspective. Do you have anything else you want to add?</b></p>
		<p class="article-text">Nothing really, thank you for having me.</p>
