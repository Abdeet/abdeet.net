		<p class="article-text"><i>This report was written by Kilanga Times correspondents shortly after Nathan Price's death. At the time, the correspondents didn't know his identity nor fully understand the situation, as evidenced by what is written in the following report</i></p>
		<br>
		<p class="article-text">A white man has been found dead in the forest near the village of Kilanga. The body bore burn marks and animal bites, and was partially decomposed. Locals described the man as a local madman, who attempted on multiple occasions to lure children into the nearby crocodile-infested river. The locals, ostensibly fed up, attempted to chase him out of the village. Instead of leaving, he climbed atop a guard post and refused to leave. The locals lit the post on fire, and instead of jumping down, the man let the fire spread to him. His body was dragged away by animals. The locals say he is survived by his four wives, though there is no evidence of their location. As more information arrives, we will continue to update this story.</p>
