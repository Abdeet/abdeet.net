		<p class="article-text"><i>This article is from the Bethlehem Inquirer, the Prices' high school newspaper. In this interview, we see Leah's naive worldview and her full faith in her father.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p class="article-text">While most of her friends are preparing for homecoming and getting tickets to the high school game, Leah Price, a freshman at Bethlehem High, has very different plans. She is scheduled to move to the Congo in a month. Her father, Reverend Nathan Price, plans to bring Christianity to the native tribes of the Congo. Leah's entire family, which consists of her father, mother, and three sisters, will accompany him. We met with Leah in the hallway before lunch to ask her what she was thinking. </p>
		<p class="article-text">Leah said she was excited to go to the Congo. She said that religion was the most important thing to her and she wanted to make a positive difference in the world. According to her, the people of the Congo do not have religion, and converting them to Christianity will improve their lives. When we asked her about her father, she told us that she respects him very much. She wants to follow in his footsteps and work in the ministry after she finishes schooling. On that note, we asked her whether she would go to a local school and she told us that her mother would homeschool her. Finally, we asked Leah how her sisters were reacting to the news. She told us that her older sister Rachel seemed displeased to be going, but she was sure that would change once they had a chance to do godly work. She wasn't sure how her twin sister Adah felt, but no one is ever really sure what Adah is thinking. Her younger sister Ruth May didn't really seem to understand what was happening.</p>
		<p class="article-text">We also did a survey asking other students in the hallway if they would live in the Congo for a year. We got one 'yes' response, five 'no' responses, and fifteen people said they didn't know what the Congo was.</p>
		<p class="article-text">In the future, the Bethlehem Inquirer Investigative Team plans to get to the bottom of the change in school lunch quality, along with verifying the allegations that Mr. Richards is secretly a communist. Make sure to read every issue of the Bethlehem Inquirer to stay up-to-date with the news.</p>
