					<p class="article-text"><b>KINSHASA</b> - Early last morning, Mobutu Sese Seko, the former president of Zaire, fled the country after failed peace talks with Laurent-D&eacute;sir&eacute; Kabila. Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo now control the entire country. It is expected that in the coming days Kabila will formally assume his position as leader of a new, free Congo. The war, which was the culmination of the slow fall from grace of Mobutu in the political world, lasted only a few months and saw a multinational alliance of African countries including Rwanda and Uganda quickly move to restore order to the region. Now, the people of Congo and the editors of The Kilanga Times only hope that the end of this episode marks the beginning of an era of peace that will last for generations.</p>
