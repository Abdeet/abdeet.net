            <h2>Car Seat Headrest - My Boy - Twin Fantasy</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Baba talking to Rahim Khan about how he doesn't understand Amir</h3>
            <p><em>My Boy - Twin Fantasy</em> is sung from the perspective of a father. The father expresses the desire to see their son more because they don't each other much right now. Baba expresses regret that he is so different from Amir and that they don't have much in common. Later in the book, Baba and Amir's relationship improves and they spend more time together.</p>

            <h2>Bill Callahan - My Friend</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Amir and Hassan eating pomegranates and carving their names into the tree</h3>
            <p><em>My Friend</em> is about two people who love each other platonically. They might not be <q>cut from the same tree</q>, but they <q>share a common dream</q>. At this point in the book, Amir and Hassan are really good friends who both have the same interests. This song is also ironic because later in the book it is revealed that Amir and Hassan are indeed <q>cut from the same tree</q>.</p>

            <h2>The Microphones - I Want Wind to Blow</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Hassan's rape scene</h3>
            <p><em>I Want Wind to Blow</em> is about someone who feels no hope. Nothing in the world is <q>black or white</q>, everything is just <q>pointless waste</q>. The person wants the wind to sweep them off their feet and take them to where they <q>can see days pass by</q> them and they don't have to hold their head in grief. This song applies to both Hassan and Amir. Hassan feels depressed after he gets raped and loses interest in everything for weeks. Amir really wants to go back to a time before any of this happened, and this regret and guilt sticks around for decades.</p>

            <h2>Bill Callahan - Eid Ma Clack Shaw</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Amir unable to get over his guilt at what happened to Hassan</h3>
            <p><em>Eid Ma Clack Shaw</em> is about a man trying to get over the pain of the past. He wants to find <q>the way to shake a memory</q>. The climax of the song is when he hears a song in his dream that <q>held all the answers</q> but he discovers in the morning that there isn't any way to hide from memories. Amir tries to avoid Hassan but is unable to do so. He decides that he will frame Hassan for theft to get him away. But even though he separates himself from Hassan as much as possible, it's not enough to really shake his memories.</p>

            <h3>Scene: Hassan and Ali leaving Kabul for Hazarajat</h3>
            <p><em>Walking the Cow</em> is about having a burden you have to carry. The person who is walking the cow <q>tried to reach out; but it's gone</q>. Hassan's last sacrifice for Amir is admitting to a crime he didn't commit. He tries to mend his relationship with Amir but is not able to.</p>

            <h3>Scene: Hassan sees Soraya for the first time at the market</h3>
            <p><em>Dreaming of You</em> is about someone who is in love. Amir is infatuated with Soraya on first sight and this song reflects that feeling. Amir finds it hard to sleep when he first meets Soraya and spends a lot of his time thinking about her and trying to make up reasons to talk to her.</p>

            <h3>Scene: Amir getting the call from Rahim Khan summoning him to Pakistan</h3>
            <p>The chorus of this song goes <q>Shoulders roll with the dunes/I found a place where no one matters/Now it flows from my mouth/Like a stroke down memory lane</q>. This summarizes Amir's life once he moves to the United States. He thinks he has left behind his past and has moved on. But when Rahim Khan's call comes in, it all comes down on him.</p>

            <h2>Daniel Johnston - Casper the Friendly Ghost</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Hassan being shot by the Taliban</h3>
            <p><em>Casper the Friendly Ghost</em> is about someone who gets no respect when they are alive. They are treated poorly by everyone. But, in spite of everything, they keep <q>smiling through [their] own personal hell</q>. This summarizes Hassan's personality. Because of reasons beyond his control like being a Hazara, he is mistreated by everyone and is eventually killed. </p>

            <h2>Daniel Johnston - True Love Will Find You in the End</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Amir discovering that Hassan was his half-brother</h3>
            <p>The lyrics of <em>True Love Will Find You in the End</em> are very fitting for this project. From <q>You'll find out just who was your friend</q> to <q>Only if you're looking for it can it find you</q>, it's easy to draw many parallels to Amir and Hassan's relationship. In the song, the singer is comforting the listener by telling them that true love will find them in the end. All they have to do is search for it. Amir tries to distance himself from Hassan as much as possible. It takes Amir decades to recognize just how true Hassan's love for him was.</p>

            <h2>Supergrass - Tales of Endurance, Pt. 4 , 5 & 6</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Driving on the highway to Kabul with Farid</h3>
            <p>Supergrass' seminal song immediately makes me think of driving down a desolate highway. It creates the perfect mood for a dark night on the road, driving somewhere important, maybe even dangerous. The lyrics are all about memories and the past, so it fits well in that aspect too.</p>

            <h2>The Evens - Cut from the Cloth</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Amir driving into Kabul and seeing how much it has changed</h3>
            <p><em>Cut from the Cloth</em> is about a familiar place feeling foreign. The singer is <q>Hearing common words, common expressions/But nothing is common in [their] eyes</q>. He expresses incredulousness at how <q>people sleep amidst the slaughter</q>, like Amir is upon entering Kabul. He sees many places from the past, but they look alien to him.</p>

            <h2>Goldfinger - Superman</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Amir fights Assef</h3>
            <p>The final song on this playlist is <em>Superman</em>. This song is a lot more upbeat than the other ones, at least in terms of the music. This feels appropriate because the final fight between Amir and Assef is cathartic in many ways. At the same time, the lyrics of Superman are about someone growing old but not being ready to. Amir is middle-aged by the time of the book. He has settled down with Soraya and his whole adventure to Kabul comes as a surprise to everyone. Throughout the entire last half of the book, Amir spends a lot of time visiting places he remembers from his childhood and reminiscing on the past. After the fight, it feels like he has made peace with the past, and is looking forward to the future.</p>
