                    <p>Transcription is the process of converting audio-visual data into readable text, often for the purpose of indexing the information and making it searchable. I was interested in transcription because I am a total data hoarder. I save all my files in multiple locations, I make backups often, and I even have my own remote server. Transcribing sounded like a great way to help preserve this information for future generations and make research much more feasible. I decided to transcribe for the National Archives and the Smithsonian because I have a lot of respect for both organizations and the work they do.</p>

                    <p>I started by transcribing data notebooks by women astronomers at the Harvard College Observatory in the 1920s and 1930s. This project involved looking at images of the notebooks and attempting to transcribe the quantitative data these astronomers recorded along with the qualitative observations they made. At first, this was a very hard task, because many of the numbers were difficult to parse. But as I continued to transcribe, I started to get the hang of it.</p>

                    <p>One method I used to become more efficient in transcribing was the text editor Emacs. I used it on my Raspberry Pi, which I connected to on my computer. Emacs has many keybinds that allow you to quickly move around a document without having to lift your hand off the keyboard, which allowed for editing tables very quickly.</p>

                    <p>I also transcribed documents through the National Archives transcription center. One set of pages I transcribed were dockets from a legal case involving possible copyright infringement on the design of a trocar, a surgical instrument used for withdrawing fluid from a cavity. This project was interesting because I wasn't very familiar with how legal cases worked, and while transcribing the pages I also became familiar with the legal system.</p>

                    <p>Overall, transcribing with the Smithsonian and the National Archives was very easy to get involved with. The process for signing up and contributing doesn't have any barriers and once you are signed up transcription is pretty straightforward. One gripe I had with both organizations was that there wasn't a very straightforward guide to style when it came to transcription. It often varied from project to project or even page to page, and each person had idiosyncrasies that reflected in their transcriptions. However, this did not make the transcriptions any harder to understand, and I'm sure does not affect the research being done.</p>

                    <p>As a life scientist, transcription made me think more about how I create, represent, and store data. I will try and make an effort to store my data in a way that allows it to be indexed and analyzed easily. Preferably, all data should be in a standardized format so that it can be accessed by computers, which will reduce the human effort necessary. But, while data is still handwritten or recorded inconsistently, transcription will remain a necessary and vital service. I really enjoyed transcribing and I would recommend it to future ILS students.</p>
