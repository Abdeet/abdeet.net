            		<p>This spring, to satisfy the ILS service-learning requirement, I had to do 25 hours of volunteer service with an organization/organizations of my choice. I decided to volunteer with three organizations: the Smithsonian, the National Archives, and the University of Maryland Arboretum.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="text">
                	<p>My volunteer service for the Smithsonian and the National Archives involved transcribing and digitizing old documents to allow researchers to better access their contents. For the Arboretum, I helped weed flower beds and a median near the Smith School of Business.</p>

                	<p>More information about my volunteering can be found by accessing the links at the top of the page. Both of these very different experiences left me with a greater appreciation of the work that volunteers do and made me excited to volunteer again in the future.</p>
