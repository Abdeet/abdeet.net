					<p>The University of Maryland Arboretum consists of all the trees and plants on campus. Arboretum staff and volunteers take actions to maintain the health and beauty of the flora that decorate the campus. This is a very labor-intensive process, which makes time volunteering very worthwhile.</p>

					<p>When I volunteered with the Arboretum, our site was the flower beds near the clock tower by the Robert H. Smith School of Business on south campus. We met at 10:00 AM and were quickly put to work. Our job was to weed the flower beds. This wasn't as easy as it sounded; many of the weeds looked uncannily similar to the plants we were trying to protect. But after some time we got into the groove of things and the weeding was going pretty well.</p>

                	<p>After about an hour had elapsed, we were wrapping up the flower beds and were shuttled to the next site. This was a grassy median on a road that went right by campus. There were a bunch of weeds all over the median and soon we were pulling out fistfuls of weeds and sticking them into trash bags. With our combined efforts, we cleaned up the median and called it a day.</p>

                	<p>Volunteering with the Arboretum taught me a lot about the amount of effort it takes to manage just one small part of the natural world on campus. I have a lot more respect for the people that work to keep our campus looking so beautiful. One important insight that I will draw from this opportunity to my career in life science is an appreciation for plant science and the wonderful world.</p>

					<p>The UMD Arboretum is a good organization to volunteer for because the process for volunteering is very simple and you feel like you have been productive at the end of the session. I would recommend volunteering with the Arboretum to future ILS students!</p>
