		<p>I'm not a very objective critic - really I'm not much of a critic at all. Here I'll link songs and albums I really like whenever I get around to updating it. Don't expect any genius insights or analysis: I'll leave that to the experts. - :D</p>

		<h2>Past Favorite Albums</h2>
		<h3><b>of Montreal - The Early Four Track Recordings</b></h3>

		<p>Ignore the whole Dustin Hoffman thing. It has nothing to do with the actual songs. This is one of their first albums, in case you couldn't tell from the title. Every song on this album is great. Some of the ones that stand out to me are &quot;Dustin Hoffman Quits Bathroom and Climbs a Tree&quot; - which is the song that got me into the album in the first place :D - and &quot;Dustin Hoffman Thinks About Eating the Soap&quot;. This album deserves at least a full listen because of how great it is.</p>
