		<p>This song is great. I'm not much of a western musician, so I can't comment on the specifics, but the actual instrument stuff sounds great. The chorus is pretty awesome. When the background singers start singing its cool. The part after it gets more tinny where the main singer goes &quot;well alright&quot; gives me goosebumps. I like this song a lot.</p>
