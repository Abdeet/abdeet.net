		<h2>Abdeet's favorite music</h2>
		<p>I'm not a very objective critic - really I'm not much of a critic at all. Here I'll link songs and albums I really like whenever I get around to updating it. Don't expect any genius insights or analysis: I'll leave that to the experts. - :D</p>

		<h2>Current Favorite Song: Natalia Lafourcade - El Pato<b></b></h2>

		<p>I discovered this song in the opening credits of Duck Season (Temporada de patos) on Netflix while taking the bus back to school. First of all, the movie is great, so watch it if you get a chance. Second of all, this song is amazing. It is an earworm; I can't get it out of my mind and when I listen to it I find myself hitting the repeat button. From what I understand, it's a Spanish cover of O Pato, a Portuguese song by Brazilian musician Jo&atilde;o Gilberto (the father of bossa nova). I think it's one of the best songs I've ever heard.</p>

		<h2>Current Favorite Album: <b>Quasi - Featuring "Birds"</b></h2>

		<p>Every track on this song bangs. Yes, that includes the eponymous "Birds". It might have been "I Never Want To See You Again" that first introduced me to Quasi - with Sam Coomes' beautiful lyrics and Janet Weiss' stellar percussion - but after listening to the entire album, I can't really say what my favorite is. Maybe "Only Success Can Fail Me Now". No, maybe it's "Please Do". Or maybe it's "Tomorrow You'll Hide" or "The Poisoned Well" or "Repetition" or... you get the idea.</p>
