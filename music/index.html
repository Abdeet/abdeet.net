		<h2>Abdeet's favorite music</h2>
		<p>I'm not a very objective critic - really I'm not much of a critic at all. Here I'll link songs and albums I really like whenever I get around to updating it. Don't expect any genius insights or analysis: I'll leave that to the experts. - :D</p>

		<h2>Current Favorite Song: <b>Half Japanese - One Million Kisses</b></h2>

		<p>It's really weird saying I like this song because of the title but something about the way the singer sings it and the guitar sounds and the whole lo-fi thing going on is just so alluring. I find myself listening to it again and again.</p>

		<h2>Current Favorite Album: <b>Quasi - Featuring "Birds"</b></h2>

		<p>Every track on this song bangs. Yes, that includes the eponymous "Birds". It might have been "I Never Want To See You Again" that first introduced me to Quasi - with Sam Coomes' beautiful lyrics and Janet Weiss' stellar percussion - but after listening to the entire album, I can't really say what my favorite is. Maybe "Only Success Can Fail Me Now". No, maybe it's "Please Do". Or maybe it's "Tomorrow You'll Hide" or "The Poisoned Well" or "Repetition" or... you get the idea.</p>
